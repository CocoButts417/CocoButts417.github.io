        <h1>About CoachFD</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Matt Woolvett</strong>, a professional Fire Fighter with Kitchener Fire since 2022, and the creator of CoachFD. My road into the Fire Service wasn’t straight or easy — and that’s exactly why I built this project.</p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>Back in 2008, I took the Fire Fighter training program at Lakeland College in Vermilion, Alberta. Like many, I thought finishing school would mean I was ready to step right into the job. It wasn’t that simple. I spent years sending out applications across Ontario and Canada, with nothing but rejection letters and frustration to show for it.</p>

  <p>Life carried on until 2016, when I moved to New Hamburg, Ontario. That move opened a door I hadn’t had before: the chance to apply to my local volunteer Fire Department. In 2018, I joined as a recruit, and that experience changed everything. It put me back in the game and gave me the hands-on training and exposure I’d been missing since school.</p>

  <p>A year later, in 2019, I took another big step: I applied to Kitchener Fire Department’s Communications Division and was hired as a Part-Time Dispatcher. That role was huge for me. Dispatch sharpened my understanding of how a fire service really operates — the big picture, the flow of calls, and the people behind the radios. It gave me a perspective that most Fire Fighters never see, and it made me a stronger applicant when I later went for suppression.</p>

  <p>By the fall of 2021, I was selected for Kitchener Fire’s Suppression Division. Since then, I’ve been working as a full-time Fire Fighter, and I haven’t looked back.</p>

        <h2>What Helped Me Succeed</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest reasons I eventually broke through had nothing to do with luck — it was the result of <strong>interview practice and persistence</strong>.</p>

        <p>I had years of experience interviewing for jobs I never settled on, and those reps paid off. Over time, I learned the power of <strong>pre-planned stories</strong> that hit specific <strong>competencies</strong>. I leaned heavily on the <strong>STAR method</strong> — not my invention, of course, but I’m living proof it works when you use it properly.</p>
  <p>I had years of experience interviewing for jobs I never settled on, and those reps paid off. Over time, I learned the power of <strong>pre-planned stories</strong> that hit specific <strong>competencies</strong> - not so I could merely recite these stories, but commit the moments to memory and recall them when it made sense. I leaned heavily on the <strong>STAR method</strong> — not my invention, of course, but I’m living proof it works when you use it properly.</p>

        <p>That structured approach didn’t just give me confidence and consistency in panel interviews — it also gave me the ability to show up as my <strong>authentic self</strong>. Instead of freaking out internally about what they might ask next, I could focus on connecting with the panel, establishing rapport, and actually <em>being me</em>. I think that authenticity was a big part of my success, and it’s something I carry forward into how I coach candidates today.</p>

        <h2>Why CoachFD Exists</h2>
        <p>I know firsthand how tough it is to break into the Fire Service. Hundreds of applicants. Expensive processes. <strong>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)</strong> filtering resumes. <strong>Panel interviews</strong> designed to test you under pressure.</p>

        <p>I also know what finally made the difference for me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>resume and cover letter</strong> that stood out.</li>
          <li><strong>Interview prep</strong> using the STAR method and competency-based answers.</li>
          <li>Real experience — and insight into how the system actually works.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That’s what CoachFD is here to give you.</p>

        <h2>What I Offer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fire Fighter interview prep</strong> that’s realistic, not generic.</li>
          <li><strong>Cover letter and resume services</strong> tuned for Canadian and Ontario hiring.</li>
          <li><strong>Mock interviews</strong> built to feel like the real thing.</li>
          <li>Straightforward feedback, delivered honestly — the same way I’d want it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At CoachFD, you’re getting personal coaching from someone who’s walked the long road, worked in Dispatch and on the trucks, and understands what Chiefs, HR, and panels expect. I’m not here to blow smoke or make empty promises. I value your time, your money, and your career goals. My job is to help you walk into every step of the process prepared, confident, and ready to show why you belong in the Fire Service.</p>
