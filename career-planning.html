      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>New candidates — no training or experience, just exploring what’s required.</li>
        <li>Recent graduates — wondering how to turn school into next steps.</li>
        <li>Experienced applicants — applying repeatedly but not moving forward.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Before the session:</strong> You’ll fill out a short form about your background, where you are now, and what you’ve tried.</li>
        <li><strong>During the session (60 min):</strong> We’ll go through your situation step by step. I’ll share real options: schools, certifications, or other resources available in your region.</li>
        <li><strong>After the session:</strong> You’ll receive a written outline of your next steps so you aren’t left guessing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What You’ll Get</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A practical roadmap, based on where you are right now.</li>
        <li>A list of training programs, schools, and courses to explore (with pros and cons).</li>
        <li>Honest feedback if something is missing from your application.</li>
        <li>A clearer understanding of how to move forward.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This isn’t a magic key to get hired tomorrow. It’s a plan you can work with. The effort and outcome will depend on you.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <p><strong>Q.</strong> Do you guarantee I’ll get hired?</p>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> No. Be extremely weary of anyone who does. What I can guarantee is that you’ll walk away knowing your next steps and where to focus your time.</p>
        <p><strong>Q.</strong> Is this only for people just starting out?</p>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> No. It works whether you’re brand new, a recent grad, or already applying without success.</p>
        <p><strong>Q.</strong> Is this done online?</p>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> Yes — all sessions are virtual, via Google Meet.</p>
